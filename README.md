# Evercam Server

Evercam Server is the component that is responsible for talking  to the camera. Consider it as a "proxy" for all commands. Processes here request either snapshots or streams and then send them to storage, or to any of the client applications.

## Features

* Request snapshots from cameras
* Request rtsp stream from cameras
* Convert rtsp stream to rtmp / hls
* store snapshots
